all programs are relatively self explanitory, but some run off of text files to read and write to.
In addition you must run keyMaker to make keys before you run RSA.
to translate text for programs reading off of files go to its respective text file and enter your message. (message.txt)
detectEnglish, cryptoMath, pyperClip, and primeNum are all modules to run other programs
all files can be found at https://github.com/wrex24/caseysCrypt
I recommend running through a shell if possible.
